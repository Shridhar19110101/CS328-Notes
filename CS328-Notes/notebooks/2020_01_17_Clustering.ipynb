    "   Example - In image data, customer shopping results, anomalies, etc.    \n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimizing   \n",
    "   Example - Distributing data across various machines, cleaning up search results, facility allocation for city planning, etc.\n",

    "* When do we call the groups meaningful?\n",
    "* How many groups should the objects be divided into?\n",
    "\n",
    "So typically, there is no supervision for clustering the objects. Since there is no ground truth, evaluating the quality of clustering is often difficult.   \n",

    "What is the right way of clustering - the left or the right? Essentially, the answer depends on the application in use. However, most times, clustering might not have an end goal and there might not be a fixed application to proceed with. In such a case, to define what the right way of clustering is, we need an objective function!    \n",
