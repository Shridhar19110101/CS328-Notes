    "# Clustering  \n",
    "Clustering is one of the forms of unsupervised learning when the data does not have labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detecting patterns  \n",
    "   Example - In image data, customer shopping results, anomalies, etc.    \n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimizing   \n",
    "   Example - Distributing data across various machines, cleaning up search results, facility allocation for city planning, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When we ‘don’t know’ what exactly we are looking for\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is basically concerned with grouping the objects into a small number of meaningful groups called clusters.   \n",
    "\n",
    "However-   \n",
    "* How do we define the similarity/distance between the objects?\n",
    "* When do we call the groups meaningful?\n",
    "* How many groups should the objects be divided into?\n",
    "\n",
    "So typically, there is no supervision for clustering the objects. Since there is no ground truth, evaluating the quality of clustering is often difficult.   \n",
    "For example, consider the two clustering cases depicted in the image below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} ../assets/2020_01_17_Clustering/fig1.png\n",
    ":name: fig1\n",
    "```   \n",
    "     \n",
    "What is the right way of clustering - the left or the right? Essentially, the answer depends on the application in use. However, most times, clustering might not have an end goal and there might not be a fixed application to proceed with. In such a case, to define what the right way of clustering is, we need an objective function!    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{caution} There is no unique way of defining clusters that work for all applications.\n",
    "```        \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The most structured way to cluster the objects is the following:   \n",
    "* Specifying the number of clusters required   \n",
    "K centers / K means / K-median\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specifying cluster separation or quality   \n",
    "Dunn’s index - works on the notion of density, i.e., a set of points would be called a cluster if the points are dense enough  \n",
    "Radius - works on the notion of radius of the cluster, i.e., a set of points would count as a cluster if all the points fall within certain radius from a specific center\n",
    "\n",
    "* Graph-based measures  \n",
    "This extends the objects of clusters from being points to networks.\n",
    "For example, what would the shortest distance mean with respect to networks? Is it the shortest path between the nodes?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Working without an objective function  \n",
    "Hierarchical clustering schemes that define clusters based on some intuitive algorithms\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## K-Center\n",
    "Consider a cluster with specific cluster centers.  \n",
    "Cost of a point = Distance of the point from the closest cluster center  \n",
    "Cost of a single cluster = Maximum of all the point costs of that cluster  \n",
    "Cost of a complete clustering = Maximum of all the cluster costs, say D    \n",
